  abstract = {Brain anatomical networks are sparse, complex, and have economical small-world properties. We investigated the efficiency and cost of human brain functional networks measured using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in a factorial design: two groups of healthy old (N = 11; mean age = 66.5 years) and healthy young (N = 15; mean age = 24.7 years) volunteers were each scanned twice in a no-task or ``resting'' state following placebo or a single dose of a dopamine receptor antagonist (sulpiride 400 mg). Functional connectivity between 90 cortical and subcortical regions was estimated by wavelet correlation analysis, in the frequency interval 0.06--0.11 Hz, and thresholded to construct undirected graphs. These brain functional networks were small-world and economical in the sense of providing high global and local efficiency of parallel information processing for low connection cost. Efficiency was reduced disproportionately to cost in older people, and the detrimental effects of age on efficiency were localised to frontal and temporal cortical and subcortical regions. Dopamine antagonism also impaired global and local efficiency of the network, but this effect was differentially localised and did not interact with the effect of age. Brain functional networks have economical small-world properties---supporting efficient parallel information transfer at relatively low cost---which are differently impaired by normal aging and pharmacological blockade of dopamine transmission.},

  abstract = {Noninvasive medical neuroimaging has yielded many discoveries about the brain connectivity. Several substantial techniques mapping morphological, structural and functional brain connectivities were developed to create a comprehensive road map of neuronal activities in the human brain -namely brain graph. Relying on its non-Euclidean data type, graph neural network (GNN) provides a clever way of learning the deep graph structure and it is rapidly becoming the state-of-the-art leading to enhanced performance in various network neuroscience tasks. Here we review current GNN-based methods, highlighting the ways that they have been used in several applications related to brain graphs such as missing brain graph synthesis and disease classification. We conclude by charting a path toward a better application of GNN models in network neuroscience field for neurological disorder diagnosis and population graph integration.

  abstract = {Understanding the network organization of the brain has been a long-standing challenge for neuroscience. In the past decade, developments in graph theory have provided many new methods for topologically analysing complex networks, some of which have already been translated to the characterization of anatomical and functional brain networks.Anatomical networks at whole-brain and cellular scales in several species consistently demonstrate conservation of wiring costs and small-world topology (high clustering and short path length). Human brain anatomical networks, derived from MRI or diffusion tensor imaging data, have high-degree cortical 'hubs' and modular and hierarchical properties.Functional networks also demonstrate small-world properties at whole-brain and cellular spatial scales. Additionally, complex network properties including small-worldness and the existence of hubs are conserved over different frequency scales in functional MRI and electrophysiological data.Convergent experimental and computational data suggest that there is interdependence in the organization of structural and functional networks. The topology, synchronizability and other dynamic properties of functional networks are strongly affected by small-world and other metrics of structural connectivity. Conversely, over a slower timescale the dynamics can modulate structural network topology.Neuropsychiatric disorders can be thought of as dysconnectivity syndromes, and graph theory has already been used to quantify abnormality of structural and functional network properties in schizophrenia, Alzheimer's disease and other disorders. Graph theory can help us to understand the vulnerability of brain networks to lesions and could in future be used to provide markers of genetic risk for disorders or to measure therapeutic effects of drug treatments on functional networks.The network organization of the brain, as it is beginning to be revealed by graph theory, is compatible with the hypothesis that the brain, perhaps in common with other complex networks, has evolved both to maximize the efficiency of information transfer and to minimize connection cost, at all scales of space and time. Key issues for future work include clarifying the relationship between the brain's network properties and its emergent cognitive behaviours in health and disease.},

  abstract = {Human brain function undergoes complex transformations across the lifespan. We employed resting-state functional MRI and graph-theory approaches to systematically chart the lifespan trajectory of the topological organization of human whole-brain functional networks in 126 healthy individuals ranging in age from 7 to 85 years. Brain networks were constructed by computing Pearson's correlations in blood-oxygenation-level-dependent temporal fluctuations among 1024 parcellation units followed by graph-based network analyses. We observed that the human brain functional connectome exhibited highly preserved non-random modular and rich club organization over the entire age range studied. Further quantitative analyses revealed linear decreases in modularity and inverted-U shaped trajectories of local efficiency and rich club architecture. Regionally heterogeneous age effects were mainly located in several hubs (e.g., default network, dorsal attention regions). Finally, we observed inverse trajectories of long- and short-distance functional connections, indicating that the reorganization of connectivity concentrates and distributes the brain's functional networks. Our results demonstrate topological changes in the whole-brain functional connectome across nearly the entire human lifespan, providing insights into the neural substrates underlying individual variations in behavior and cognition. These results have important implications for disease connectomics because they provide a baseline for evaluating network impairments in age-related neuropsychiatric disorders.},

  abstract = {The human cerebral cortex is organized into functionally segregated but synchronized regions bridged by the structural connectivity of white matter pathways. While structure-function coupling has been implicated in cognitive development and neuropsychiatric disorders, studies yield inconsistent findings. The extent to which the structure-function coupling reflects reliable individual differences or primarily group-common characteristics remains unclear, at both the global and regional brain levels. By leveraging two independent, high-quality datasets, we found that the graph neural network accurately predicted unseen individuals' functional connectivity from structural connectivity, reflecting a strong structure-function coupling. This coupling was primarily driven by network topology and was substantially stronger than that of the linear models. Moreover, we observed that structure-function coupling was dominated by group-common effects, with subtle yet significant individual-specific effects. The regional group and individual effects of coupling were hierarchically organized across the cortex along a sensorimotor-association axis, with lower group and higher individual effects in association cortices. These findings emphasize the importance of considering both group and individual effects in understanding cortical structure-function coupling, suggesting insights into interpreting individual differences of the coupling and informing connectivity-guided therapeutics.},

  abstract = {The human brain is a complex network of interlinked regions. Recent studies have demonstrated the existence of a number of highly connected and highly central neocortical hub regions, regions that play a key role in global information integration between different parts of the network. The potential functional importance of these ``brain hubs'' is underscored by recent studies showing that disturbances of their structural and functional connectivity profile are linked to neuropathology. This study aims to map out both the subcortical and neocortical hubs of the brain and examine their mutual relationship, particularly their structural linkages. Here, we demonstrate that brain hubs form a so-called ``rich club,'' characterized by a tendency for high-degree nodes to be more densely connected among themselves than nodes of a lower degree, providing important information on the higher-level topology of the brain network. Whole-brain structural networks of 21 subjects were reconstructed using diffusion tensor imaging data. Examining the connectivity profile of these networks revealed a group of 12 strongly interconnected bihemispheric hub regions, comprising the precuneus, superior frontal and superior parietal cortex, as well as the subcortical hippocampus, putamen, and thalamus. Importantly, these hub regions were found to be more densely interconnected than would be expected based solely on their degree, together forming a rich club. We discuss the potential functional implications of the rich-club organization of the human connectome, particularly in light of its role in information integration and in conferring robustness to its structural core.},

  abstract = {Neuroimaging data typically include multiple modalities, such as structural or functional magnetic resonance imaging, diffusion tensor imaging, and positron emission tomography, which provide multiple views for observing and analyzing the brain. To leverage the complementary representations of different modalities, multimodal fusion is consequently needed to dig out both inter-modality and intra-modality information. With the exploited rich information, it is becoming popular to combine multiple modality data to explore the structural and functional characteristics of the brain in both health and disease status. In this paper, we first review a wide spectrum of advanced machine learning methodologies for fusing multimodal brain imaging data, broadly categorized into unsupervised and supervised learning strategies. Followed by this, some representative applications are discussed, including how they help to understand the brain arealization, how they improve the prediction of behavioral phenotypes and brain aging, and how they accelerate the biomarker exploration of brain diseases. Finally, we discuss some exciting emerging trends and important future directions. Collectively, we intend to offer a comprehensive overview of brain imaging fusion methods and their successful applications, along with the challenges imposed by multi-scale and big data, which arises an urgent demand on developing new models and platforms.},

  abstract = {The human brain is a complex network of anatomically interconnected brain areas. Spontaneous neural activity is constrained by this architecture, giving rise to patterns of statistical dependencies between the activity of remote neural elements. The non-trivial relationship between structural and functional connectivity poses many unsolved challenges about cognition, disease, development, learning and aging. While numerous studies have focused on statistical relationships between edge weights in anatomical and functional networks, less is known about dependencies between their modules and communities. In this work, we investigate and characterize the relationship between anatomical and functional modular organization of the human brain, developing a novel multi-layer framework that expands the classical concept of multi-layer modularity. By simultaneously mapping anatomical and functional networks estimated from different subjects into communities, this approach allows us to carry out a multi-subject and multi-modal analysis of the brain's modular organization. Here, we investigate the relationship between anatomical and functional modules during resting state, finding unique and shared structures. The proposed framework constitutes a methodological advance in the context of multi-layer network analysis and paves the way to further investigate the relationship between structural and functional network organization in clinical cohorts, during cognitively demanding tasks, and in developmental or lifespan studies.},

Recently, multilayer networks, a mathematical extension of traditional networks, have gained increasing popularity in neuroscience due to their ability to capture the full information of multi-model, multi-scale, spatiotemporal data sets. Here, we review multilayer networks and their applications in neuroscience, showing how incorporating the multilayer framework into network neuroscience analysis has uncovered previously hidden features of brain networks. We specifically highlight the use of multilayer networks to model disease, structure--function relationships, network evolution, and link multi-scale data. Finally, we close with a discussion of promising new directions of multilayer network neuroscience research and propose a modified definition of multilayer networks designed to unite and clarify the use of the multilayer formalism in describing real-world systems.},

The existing methods typically utilize biomarkers from anatomical MRI or functional BOLD imaging but lack the ability of revealing the relationship between integrated modalities and disease. In this paper, we developed an Edge-weighted Graph Attention Network (EGAT) with Dense Hierarchical Pooling (DHP), to better understand the underlying roots of the disorder from the view of structure-function integration. EGAT is an interpretable framework for integrating multi-modality features without loss of prediction accuracy. For the input, the underlying graph is constructed from functional connectivity matrices and the nodal features consist of both the anatomical features and the statistics of the connectivity. We investigated the potential benefits of using EGAT to classify BP vs. Healthy Control (HC), by examining the attention map and gradient sensitivity of nodal features. We indicated that associated with the abnormality of anatomical geometric properties, multiple interactive patterns among Default Mode, Fronto-parietal and Cingulo-opercular networks contribute to identifying BP.},

Mining from these rich datasets, scientists try to unveil the fundamental biological mechanisms in the human brain. However, neuroimaging data collected for constructing brain networks is generally costly, and thus extracting useful information from a limited sample size of brain networks is demanding. Currently, there are two common trends in neuroimaging data collection that could be exploited to gain more information: 1) multimodal data, and 2) longitudinal data. It has been shown that these two types of data provide complementary information. Nonetheless, it is challenging to learn brain network representations that can simultaneously capture network properties from multimodal as well as longitudinal datasets. Here we propose a general fusion framework for multi-source learning of brain networks -- multimodal brain network fusion with longitudinal coupling (MMLC). In our framework, three layers of information are considered, including cross-sectional similarity, multimodal coupling, and longitudinal consistency. Specifically, we jointly factorize multimodal networks and construct a rotation-based constraint to couple network variance across time. We also adopt the consensus factorization as the group consistent pattern. Using two publicly available brain imaging datasets, we demonstrate that MMLC may better predict psychometric scores than some other state-of-the-art brain network representation learning algorithms. Additionally, the discovered significant brain regions are synergistic with previous literature. Our new approach may boost statistical power and sheds new light on neuroimaging network biomarkers for future psychometric prediction research by integrating longitudinal and multimodal neuroimaging data.},

  abstract = {Understanding the intrinsic patterns of human brain is important to make inferences about the mind and brain-behavior association. Electrophysiological methods (i.e. MEG/EEG) provide direct measures of neural activity without the effect of vascular confounds. The blood oxygenated level-dependent (BOLD) signal of functional MRI (fMRI) reveals the spatial and temporal brain activity across different brain regions. However, it is unclear how to associate the high temporal resolution Electrophysiological measures with high spatial resolution fMRI signals. Here, we present a novel interpretable model for coupling the structure and function activity of brain based on heterogeneous contrastive graph representation. The proposed method is able to link manifest variables of the brain (i.e. MEG, MRI, fMRI and behavior performance) and quantify the intrinsic coupling strength of different modal signals. The proposed method learns the heterogeneous node and graph representations by contrasting the structural and temporal views through the mind to multimodal brain data. The first experiment with 1200 subjects from Human connectome Project (HCP) shows that the proposed method outperforms the existing approaches in predicting individual gender and enabling the location of the importance of brain regions with sex difference. The second experiment associates the structure and temporal views between the low-level sensory regions and high-level cognitive ones. The experimental results demonstrate that the dependence of structural and temporal views varied spatially through different modal variants. The proposed method enables the heterogeneous biomarkers explanation for different brain measurements.},

  abstract = {Brain large-scale dynamics is constrained by the heterogeneity of intrinsic anatomical substrate. Little is known how the spatio-temporal dynamics adapt for the heterogeneous structural connectivity (SC). Modern neuroimaging modalities make it possible to study the intrinsic brain activity at the scale of seconds to minutes. Diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) and functional MRI reveals the large-scale SC across different brain regions. Electrophysiological methods (i.e. MEG/EEG) provide direct measures of neural activity and exhibits complex neurobiological temporal dynamics which could not be solved by fMRI. However, most of existing multimodal analytical methods collapse the brain measurements either in space or time domain and fail to capture the spatio-temporal circuit dynamics. In this paper, we propose a novel spatio-temporal graph Transformer model to integrate the structural and functional connectivity in both spatial and temporal domain. The proposed method learns the heterogeneous node and graph representation via contrastive learning and multi-head attention based graph Transformer using multimodal brain data (i.e. fMRI, MRI, MEG and behavior performance). The proposed contrastive graph Transformer representation model incorporates the heterogeneity map constrained by T1-to-T2-weighted (T1w/T2w) to improve the model fit to structure-function interactions. The experimental results with multimodal resting state brain measurements demonstrate the proposed method could highlight the local properties of large-scale brain spatio-temporal dynamics and capture the dependence strength between functional connectivity and behaviors. In summary, the proposed method enables the complex brain dynamics explanation for different modal variants.},
