Different from the GNN methods
507 mentioned above, our proposed BrainGNN includes novel ROI-aware Ra-GNN
508 layers that efficiently assign each ROI an unique kernel, revealing ROI commu509 nity patterns, and novel regulation terms (unit loss, GLC loss and TPK loss)
510 for pooling operations that regulate the model to select salient ROIs. BrainGNN
511 shows superior prediction accuracy for ASD classification and brain states de512 coding compared to the alternative machine learning, FCN, CNN and GNN
513 methods. As it is shown in Fig 5), BrainGNN improves average accuracy by 3%
514 to 20% for ASD classification on the Biopoint dataset and achieves an average
515 accuracy of 93.4% on a seven-states classification task on the HCP dataset.
