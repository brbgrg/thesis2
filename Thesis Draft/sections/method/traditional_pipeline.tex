Generally, traditional pipelines for brain 
network analyses include
two stages. The first stage refers to 
feature extraction, where the effective
network features are extracted by different 
pre-defined methods. After
the feature extraction stage, statistical 
analysis will be conducted based
on the extracted features in the second 
stage. \cite{Tang2023}.
