We detected significant age-related changes modeled
by the lifespan trajectories of the functional connectome.
These findings may provide novel insights into the neural
substrates underlying the behavioral and cognitive variability 
over the lifespan, which require verification in the
future by combining the neuroimaging data and behavioral
measurements. The present study reveals the dynamics of
the topological organization of the intrinsic network architecture 
in the functional connectomics across the human
lifespan and provides a baseline for evaluating the network
impairments of various neuropsychiatric disorders.
